## Do good, create Currents

openCurrents is a community first: a collective seeking to better the world through social action, earned trust, and global currency accessible to all.

The openCurrents community is creating a decentralized currency called Currents. Anytime you give 1 verifiable hour of your time to an accepted project for social good, you earn 1 Current. Currents are guaranteed to increase in value relative to the US Dollar over the next 10 years. The rate at which the value increases depends on the growth rate of issuance and exchange of Currents. When Currents reach certain thresholds of issuance and exchange, they will be openly exchanged with other fiat and decentralized currencies at whatever rate the market deems.

If you are a business owner or service provider, you are invited to accept Currents for partial payment of your good or service. By doing so, you are not only providing a discount to those who give time freely for the greater good, but you are also collecting an asset that will grow in value and usefulness over time.

If you are part of a nonprofit, you can benefit as a volunteer or as an organizer of volunteers. Add the details of current or upcoming projects, provide a budget of required hours, and request community approval to issue Currents for the work.

If you are simply a person with an idea, big or small, to make the world a better place, then share it. If the community supports it, you'll get to create Currents with your time, and we will help you find people who want to better the world with you.

openCurrents is a work in progress. If you'd like to hear more, offer feedback, or get involved, please do not hesitate to reach out.
